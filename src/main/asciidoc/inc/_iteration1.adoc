[[iteration-1]]
= Iteration I

The Iteration-1 is supposed to be the as-is deployment of the __Brewery__ application on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].  This will have all the components from the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery
with modifications required :

- Use the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to generate the Kubernetes/OpenShift resources needed to deploy the applications on the platform
- Design OpenShift templates to deploy RabbitMQ and the different servers such as Eureka, Config-Server, Zipkin, ... (to be discussed)

to have it deployed on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift]

[[itr1-build-app]]
=== Building

Brewery application uses gradle for build, we will leverage on the same to get the application artifacts ready. To build the applicaiton
run the following command

[source,sh]
----
./gradlew -DWHAT_TO_TEST="SLEUTH_STREAM" clean build <1>
./mvnw -N install <2>
----

<1> We will be using https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Spring Cloud Sleuth] for sending trace information to https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin[Zipkin]
<2> This will install the brewery parent pom in local maven repository

[[itr1-deploy-to-openshift]]
=== Deploying to OpenShift

[WARNING]
====
As part of this lift and shift i.e to make existing application to work **as-is**, there is certain order of application deployment might be required.  
The order below is not hard rule but the best known working order during the migration effort. 
====

[[rabbitmq]]
==== RabbitMQ

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/extras/rabbitmq*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw -Dfabric8.mode=kubernetes clean fabric8:deploy
----

This will take some time to get it running as the deployment needs to download the `rabbitmq` docker image

[[config-server]]
==== Config Server

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/config-server*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
----

NOTE: Since this is the first Java application to be deployed,  it may take some time to download the necessary images from docker hub.

[[eureka]]
==== Eureka

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/eureka*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
----

[[zipkin-server]]
