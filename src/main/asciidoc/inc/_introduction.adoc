= Overview

**Green Cloud Demo** is your first step on how to migrate and optimize an existing Spring Boot application  to
https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].  The migration guides you with the process of how to migrate Spring Boot workload form other platform 
to https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift], i.e. the build process, the ideal platform (https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift]), optimizing etc.,

== Short History of Microservices

Most of the https://netflix.github.io/[Netflix OSS] components listed above are pretty old and optimized more for AWS, they are prone to some common DevOps
pain-points for organizations that are starting to adopt DevOps. The migration that will be done as part of this demo will help in alleviating those possible
DevOps pain-points and provide the organizations a direction on **How to migrate my Spring Boot Application to OpenShift**

== App Overview 
In this demo, the https://github.com/kameshsampath/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery] will be migrated 
and optimized for OpenShift, during the process of migration the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
will be modified to make it deployable on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

The application will be migrated based on these iterations,

* [*] <<iteration-1>> - As-is deployment of the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
with no code change.  The Application build process will be modified to enable easier deployment of application on Openshift

* [*] <<iteration-2>> - Will use native OpenShift/Kubernetes features such as service discovery, loadbalancing & externalization of the config

* [*] <<iteration-3>> - Optimizing stacks on OpenShift, like Apache Artemis instead of RabbitMQ, using OpenTracing and Jaeger

[[default-pre-req]]
== Pre-Requisite

You have a OpenShift cluster running locally using https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[*minishift*]
or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/Op[*CDK*], or
have access to https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[*OpenShift Container Platform*]

Check the <<res-tools>> section for more details

[WARNING]
====
- At least 7Gb of RAM is required to run the Brewery application, atleast for <<iteration-1>>
====

== Docker Setup

Before doing any deployment, its recommended to do `eval $(minishift docker-env)` from your current shell, to set up the DOCKER environment variables, that
will be needed by the fabric8 maven plugin to deploy application on OpenShift 

== Accessing the Applications

You can view the application urls from OpenShift Web Console.  A successful deployment  will have all the applications running with single pod. The following screenshots
shows how the <<deploy-eureka,Eureka>> will look like when all the clients registers with it
