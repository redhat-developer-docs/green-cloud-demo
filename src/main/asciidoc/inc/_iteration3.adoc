[[iteration-3]]
= Iteration III

The Iteration III is more of optimizing the <<iteration-2>> on OpenShift. This iteration has fair bit of code change that is required when porting the application to 
use  

* https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/[Apache Artemis] in place of RabbitMQ
* http://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] for tracing and  https://uber.github.io/jaeger/[Jaeger] in place of Zipkin
* Native Kubernetes based Load Balancing instead of Ribbon

The picture above shows how <<itr2-java-msa-platform-circa,,Java Microservices Platform - Iteration-2>> has been further optimized for https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift], with notable difference of deprecating Netflix Ribbon, as application can rely on  https://www.kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] / https://www.openshift.com[Openshift] for client side load balancing.  As part of the optimization from <<iteration-2>>, many modules/projects are <<itr3-deprecated-modules,deprecated>>.

[[itr3-application-setup]]
== Setup

[[itr3-clone-source]]
=== Clone

[source,sh]
----
git clone -b iteration-3 https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/brewery.git
----

[NOTE]
====
Through out this document we will call the directory where the project was cloned as _$PROJECT_HOME_
====

[[itr3-pre-req]]
== Pre-Requisite

[[itr3-pre-req-general]]
=== General
The spring-cloud-kubernetes library used in the project requires the `default` service account to have view permissions, to enable that we execute the following command,

[source,sh]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view -z default -n $(oc project -q)

[[itr3-build-app]]
=== Building

The Iteration II of the brewery application has migrated all the projects to http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] based build,
to build the application run the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw -N install <1>
./mvnw clean install <2>
----
<1> This will install the brewery parent pom in local maven repository
<2> This will build the applications, if the minishift or OpenShift cluster is running, this will trigger `s2i` builds
of the respective application as well

[[itr3-deploy-to-openshift]]
=== Deploying to OpenShift

As part of this lift and shift of existing application, to make it work as-is, there is certain order of applicaiton deployment might be required.  The following section
explains the deployment of the application in the same order as expected  ( you can expriment with it if you like :) )


[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that all <<itr3-pre-req,Pre-Requisite>> are done before starting deployment.
====

[[itr3-artemis]]
==== Apache Artemis

Starting this iteration, the application will be using https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/[Apache Artemis] as message broker in place of RabbitMQ, the following sections details on deploying 
Apache Artemis on OpenShift

[[itr3-apache-artemis-local]]
===== Local Deployment

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/extras/apache-artemis*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw -Dfabric8.mode=kubernetes clean fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-apache-artemis-cloud]]
===== External Cloud Deployment

Sometimes you might have access to docker socket typical case when deploying to external cloud, in those cases you can run the following set of commands,

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:resource
oc apply -f target/classes/META-INF/fabric8/openshift.yml
----

This will take some time to get it running as the deployment needs to download the `apache-artemis` docker image

[[itr3-jaeger]]
==== Jaeger Server

The Jaeger distribution provides the OpenShift deployment manifests to deploy Jaeger, as part of this demo 
the https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift[all-in-one] deployment will be used.

[source,sh]
----
cd $PROJECT_HOME/extras/jaeger
oc process -f jaeger-all-in-one-template.yml  | oc create -f -
----

[NOTE]
====
Please use the template from sources for all-in-deployment of Jaeger, any version above 0.8.0 is not able to display order traces as expected 
====

[[itr3-zuul]]
==== Zuul

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/zuul*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-ingredients]]
==== Ingredients

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/ingredients*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-reporting]]
==== Reporting

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/reporting*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-brewing]]
==== Brewing

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/brewing*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-presenting]]
==== Presenting

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/presenting*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw fabric8:deploy
----

[[itr3-open-issues]]
== Open Issues

[[itr3-tracing-traces]]
=== Tracing 
The traces generated by OpenTracing right now has order traces broken because right now there is no instrumentation for Spring Streams.  The instrumentation
is under development.

[[itr3-acceptance-testing]]
=== Acceptance Testing

As this iteration has lot of module updates and replacements, the old acceptance tests does not hold good. The automated Arquillain based automated tests development
is in progress, this section will be updated with needed details once its in place. 

[[itr3-deprecated-modules]]

== Deprecated Modules

As part of Iteration-III the following modules have been deprecated,

* Eureka
* Config Server
* common-zipkin
* common-zipkin-old
* common-zipkin-stream
* zipkin-server
* zookeeper
* docker
